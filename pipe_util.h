/*
 * A pipeline consists of a list of functions and pipes. As data is recieved in
 * one end, it is processed by each of the pipes and pushed into the other end.
 * Each stage's processing is done in a separate thread. The last parameter must
 * be NULL (in place of a pipe_processor_t) if you want to have a consumer_t
 * returned, or 0 (in place of a sizeof()) if you don't want or need a consumer_t.
 * If the last parameter replaces a sizeof(), the return value's `c' member will
 * be NULL.
 *
 * When passing NULL `aux' pointers to your functors, you MUST cast them to
 * void* to maintain 64-bit compatibility. The C standard only requires NULL to
 * be defined as 0, so will be cast to a 32-bit wide int. This will destroy
 * alignment since pipe_pipeline looks for a void* in that space.
 *
 * Sample:
 *  pipeline_t p = pipe_pipeline(0, sizeof(int),
 *                               &int_to_float,       &i2f_data,   sizeof(float),
 *                               &float_to_garbage,   &f2g_data,   sizeof(garbage),
 *                               &garbage_to_awesome, (void*)NULL, sizeof(awesome),
 *                               (void*)NULL
 *                              );
 *
 *  // Now push all your ints into p.p ...
 *
 *  pipe_producer_free(p.p);
 *
 *  // Now pop all your awesome out of p.c ...
 *
 *  pipe_consumer_free(p.c);
 *
 *  NOTE: All the functions must be of type pipe_processor_t. This call will
 *  return a pipeline which takes the type specified by the first parameter
 *  [int] and returns the last type [awesome] (or NULL if the last vararg was a
 *  function).
